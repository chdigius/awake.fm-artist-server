      # The Residency

      From 2018 to 2021, Awake.fm held a residency on **Bassdrive.com**, one of the world's most respected drum & bass radio stations. 
      Broadcasting to listeners worldwide, these sessions showcased the deepest cuts in liquid, atmospheric, and intelligent drum & bass.

      Each set was recorded in two versions:
      - **Live Sessions** - Original broadcasts with voiceovers, shoutouts, and DJ personality
      - **Music-Only Sets** - Pure mix flow for uninterrupted listening

      ## Archive Note
