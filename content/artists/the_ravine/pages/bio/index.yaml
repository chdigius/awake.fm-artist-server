          ## Origins
          
          The Ravine began in 2022 as a solo project exploring the intersection of 
          post-metal, drone, and ambient music. What started as bedroom experiments 
          with layered guitars and field recordings evolved into a fully-realized 
          sonic identity.
          
          ## Philosophy
          
          The music of The Ravine is built on contrasts: beauty and brutality, 
          silence and noise, patience and catharsis. Each composition is designed 
          to be experienced as a complete journey, demanding attention and rewarding 
          those who surrender to its flow.
