          This node is independently operated and fully artist-owned.
          It participates in the Awake.fm network to distribute music,
          host server-level releases, and offer merch without corporate
          intermediaries.

          All content is managed through a flat-file content graph.  
          Every folder is a node.  
          Every artist has a home.  
          Every release lives forever.

          Welcome to the future of digital autonomy.
