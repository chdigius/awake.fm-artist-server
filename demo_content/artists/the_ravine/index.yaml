          **The Ravine** emerged from the depths of experimental metal and ambient drone, 
          forging a sound that balances crushing heaviness with ethereal beauty. 
          
          Drawing influence from Neurosis, Isis, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, 
          The Ravine creates expansive sonic landscapes where distorted guitars 
          cascade like avalanches and quiet moments shimmer with tension.
          
          Each composition is a journey—patient, deliberate, and emotionally devastating.
