          **Descent** (2024) - 8:47
          A slow-burning journey into darkness. Layers of distorted guitars build over droning bass, 
          culminating in a crushing climax before dissolving into ambient whispers.
          
          **Echoes in Stone** (2024) - 11:23  
          Post-metal at its most patient. Delicate clean guitars weave through feedback and delay, 
          gradually giving way to monolithic riffs that shake the foundation.
          
          **The Weight of Silence** (2023) - 6:15
          An instrumental meditation on loss. Sparse, haunting melodies drift over rumbling low-end, 
          creating space for reflection and catharsis.
