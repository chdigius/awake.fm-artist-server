## 5. Emergent Categories and Creator-Driven Evolution

A defining principle of Awake.fm is that the network itself—not a central
authority—determines how the platform evolves. The system is built on a simple,
universal rule:

    Any folder with an `index.yaml` is content.

This means an artist can publish *anything* on their node:

- music (albums, tracks, sets)
- visual art (illustrations, photography, posters)
- video (short films, music videos, performance clips)
- writing (essays, zines, lore documents)
- projects (gear builds, plugins, electronics)
- experimental media (interactive pieces, AI work, generative art)
- any category they invent themselves

Awake.fm does not force artists into predefined formats. There are no
“approved” content types and no corporate taxonomy. The creative surface area
is defined entirely by the artist.

### Decentralized Discovery

The Awake.fm mothership indexes nodes across the network by reading their
content graphs. Because each artist can define any hierarchy they want, new
categories emerge naturally. If hundreds of artists create folders like:

    art/
    film/
    video/
    blog/
    photography/
    projects/
    comics/
    poetry/

…the mothership gains the ability to surface those as top-level discovery
categories—*without* requiring a platform update or policy change.

This is evolutionary UX: the network grows as artists create.

Awake.fm doesn’t tell creators what they can publish.
Creators show Awake.fm what the creative world actually is.

### Flexibility Without Lock-In

Because every leaf node is just a folder + YAML file, artists maintain:

- complete ownership
- full portability
- version control via Git
- the ability to host content anywhere (local disk, GitHub, S3, Gitea, IPFS)
- the freedom to define their own structure

Awake.fm then reads, understands, and connects these nodes across the network.

A guitarist who also posts short horror films?  
A DJ who publishes VR art and synth diagrams?  
A producer who writes cyberpunk fiction alongside their music?

All supported. No configuration required.

### Protocol, Not Platform

This shift transforms Awake.fm from a “music platform” into a **creative
protocol**:

- Artist nodes define content.
- The mothership observes patterns across thousands of nodes.
- Categories emerge from real creative activity.
- The network expands organically in the direction artists push it.

No CEO decides what Awake.fm becomes.  
No shareholders demand pivots.  
The network grows the way a culture grows—through collective expression.

Awake.fm starts as decentralized Bandcamp, but evolves into a sovereign
creative ecosystem shaped entirely by its participants.

This is the future of Web-native creativity:  
simple primitives, total freedom, network-wide emergence.
